How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensurance of a programs functionality and security is best done right when its written, as it is still fresh in the mind and will allow more clearer context in the given project. JUnit testing is an automated tool that aids in this ensurance and checks any recent changes made for any mistakes that may pop up. This type of testing not only checks for code stablitiy but creates a faster work flow by allowing the developer to observe the output as the manual review. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Proper interpretation of user needs is best done with a meeting and interview with not only the clients that provided the work but potential users that fit the demographic of the program. Coverage in user needs, especially before development, can help conclude what actually needs to be solved instead of spending that time during actual development.

How do I approach designing software?

Mentioned before, clear and concise understanding of user needs, client requirements and the architecture of your program is a good start when approaching software design. What helps in most cases is a creation of a prototype. A prototype allows a thorough review of user needs through the mistakes/flaws of a model that is subject to change. A strong foundation in the concept of a program is given and constant revisions bring it closer to its ideal form.
